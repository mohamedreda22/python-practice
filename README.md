# Python Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Python Practice** repository! This repository is dedicated to practicing and testing Python programs across various topics, from basic syntax to algorithms and more advanced concepts.

## Overview

This repository contains various Python programs, including algorithms, basic calculators, and useful tools, that help me improve my Python skills and knowledge. Here's a brief overview of the programs included:

## Programs

### 1. **Bisection Search Algorithm**
   - This program implements the **Bisection Search Algorithm**, which is used to efficiently search for a value in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
   - This approach helps in finding the correct element more quickly compared to a linear search.

### 2. **Calculator**
   - A simple Python program that acts as a basic calculator. It can perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.
   - The program allows users to enter their desired operation and calculates the result accordingly.

### 3. **Contacts Dictionary**
   - This program uses Python's dictionary data structure to manage a list of contacts. It allows the user to add, display, and delete contacts.
   - The contacts are stored with names as keys and phone numbers as values.

### 4. **Even or Odd Number**
   - A simple program that checks if a given number is **even** or **odd**. The program takes input from the user and determines the result based on divisibility by 2.

### 5. **To-Do List**
   - A **To-Do List** program that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks.
   - This program helps with task management, where each task is stored in a list and can be modified as needed.

## Setup

To get started with the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohamedreda22/python-practice.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd python-practice
   ```

3. Start writing or modifying Python code in your local environment. To run a Python file, use:
   ```bash
   python <filename>.py
   ```
